		Factoring is the reverse process of getting the product of any number or algebraic	expression.

    	\frametitle{What is Factoring?}
    	To factor a polynomial means to describe the algebraic
    	expression as the product of two or more expressions.

    \begin{frame}
    	\frametitle{What is Common Factor?}
    	When a factor is contained in every term of an algebraic expression, it is called the common factor.

    	\begin{enumerate}
    		\item<1-> Factor out the greatest common monomial of all terms of the given expression.
    		\item<2-> Divide each term of the expression by the greatest common factor. The resulting expression is the other factor.
    	\end{enumerate}
